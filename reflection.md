Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was mostly just difficult to grasp conceptually, espeically when I was starting the assignment. Probably I would advise starting the assignment soon and going to office hours sooner. The refurbish function was super confusing, mostly because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put it in the computer file or the resale shop file. But mostly I think the code works I think.
